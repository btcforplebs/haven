// MARK: - Tile fetching
//
// The half of the media problem the app cannot solve for us.
//
// Blossom blobs living on this device are shrunk by the app and handed over as
// bytes (see NVThumbnails). Media hosted anywhere else has no local file to
// shrink, so it has to come down the wire — and the only place a widget may do
// that is its timeline provider, which is async and does have a network. The
// widget's `body` has neither, which is why `AsyncImage` renders a placeholder
// and never resolves.
//
// Everything here is therefore best-effort and firmly time-boxed: a widget that
// takes too long to produce a timeline gets its entry dropped, so a slow host
// must cost us that tile, never the whole grid.
