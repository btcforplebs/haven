/// validation, and for most of its callers that is fine — a malformed nevent
/// simply fails to resolve and nothing is written down. A malformed npub in the
/// follow list is different: it decodes to *something*, and that something is
/// published to relays under the user's key and stays in their contact list.
///
/// Both failure modes are real and both are in the shipped starter packs:
///   - a typo'd npub still yields 32 plausible bytes, so the user follows a
///     pubkey nobody chose;
///   - an npub containing a later "1" splits at the wrong separator, because
///     the decoder takes the *last* one, and yields a 3-byte "pubkey" that goes
///     into a p-tag as-is.
///
/// Keeping this self-contained (no dependency on Bech32) is deliberate: it is
/// mirrored into MediaLogicTests so the rule is covered by tests.
