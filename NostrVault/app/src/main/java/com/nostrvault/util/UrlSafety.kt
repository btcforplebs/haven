/**
 * SSRF guard for fetching attacker-controlled URLs (e.g. link previews built from
 * note content).
 *
 * The app runs an on-device Nostr relay, Blossom server, and Haven bridge on
 * `https://localhost:<port>`, and may sit on a LAN. Without a
 * guard, a hostile note containing `http://127.0.0.1:<relayPort>/...` (or a public
 * URL that 302-redirects there) would make the app issue requests to its own
 * internal services or to other LAN hosts.
 *
 * Usage: validate every URL before fetching it AND after every redirect hop.
 * Fails closed — anything that can't be resolved/parsed is treated as unsafe.
